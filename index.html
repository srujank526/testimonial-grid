        <article style=" opacity: 50%;">"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. Ineeded some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
          step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very 
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
          fact, I;ve often referred to it during interviews as an examlpe of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
